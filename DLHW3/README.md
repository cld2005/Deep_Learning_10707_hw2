In this assignment, the software are developed for question 3 (1) to (4).

Please use MatLab which supports gpuArray. Not optional.

For 3.1 Data Processing please run src/Preprocessing.java to perform data preprossing. This java program will generate a dict.txt which contains the top 8000 words, frequency count for all the 4-grams in fourGramCount.txt, and the 50 highest frequency 4-grams in fourGram50.txt. Also, according to the ranking in the 8000 words, it will convert the train.txt and val.txt into to 4-grams represented by the index in the dictionary. fourgramcount.m will plot the distribution of all 4-grams.

For 3.2, there are dedicated main_3_2_*.m for each of the hidden layer size, please run accordingly.

For 3.3, please run main_3_3_tanh_128.m.

For 3.4, please run main_3_4_predict_ten.m to predict 10 words and main_3_4_word_distance.m to calculate distance between 2 word vectors. Notice that these 2 main scripts uses best_model_size_128_linear_0.mat which is generated by running main_3_3_tanh_128.m in 3.3. It is not included due to the size of the model.

For 3.5, please run main_3_5_tanh_128_embed_2.m to train the 2D word embedding and make the plot
